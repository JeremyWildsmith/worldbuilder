Source Code Repository for JevaEngine - An Isoemtric Java Game Engine

JevaEngine is currently under very early development, and the source code is still being
conditioned for user contribution.

License
========
JevaEngine is open-sourced under the GPLv3 License:

Features
========
- Pure Java Implementation. No native dependencies, maximizing cross-platform ability.
- Fully Scriptable. Scriptable scenes, events & NPCs (Scripts are written in JavaScript)
- UI Is entirely skinnable and customizable - Jeva Core provides a solid infastructure for most general UI components.
- Basic particle engine (implemented primary for attack\heal\projectile effects so nothing too fancy)
- Fully capable quest system & dialogue system (dialogue can be complex with various pathways which effect any internal variables of the character (i.e. moral))
- Most of the engine is entirely extensible - with logical partitions in implementation logic between Java and external scripts.
- Map Editor, Dialogues can be contructed via freemind
